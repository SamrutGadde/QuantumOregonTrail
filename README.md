## The Quantum Oregon Trail

This is a game that I made for my midterm project for my Quantum Computing class. It is a web-based game that uses ReactJS and Python with Qiskit and Websockets to create a simplified implmentation of the Oregon
Trail game that uses quantum computing to generate random events.

## How to Play
Requirements: 
- Python 3.7 or higher
- NodeJS LTS or higher

To play the game, you must first install the dependencies. To do this, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
npm install
```

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the game by running the following commands in the root directory of the project:

```
npm run server
```

and in a different terminal window:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the game server and the game client. You can then access the game by going to the localhost link that appears in the terminal.
